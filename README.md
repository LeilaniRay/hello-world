# hello-world
Beginning my exploration through GitHub
Hello, my name is Leilani. I want to learn everything about coding, which is an insane goal. I enjoy what I have learned so far in college earning my Associate's degree in Software Development. With each assignment my list of more things I want to learn multiplies. I have created a GitHub account for classwork and now here I am starting again on my own.
